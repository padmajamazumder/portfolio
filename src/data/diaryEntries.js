      She is worshipped in the form of stone,<br>
      but when made of skin and bone,<br>
      Only men are entitled to have hormone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Worshipped as goddess when the sun is high,<br>
      but by dusk, she's just prey under the sky.<br>
      The very hands that prayed with pride<br>
      now crawl where dignity's denied.<br>
      when worshiped, she rides tigers<br>
      and then men expects them to be the tiger.<br>
      she slays demons with a fiery gaze —<br>
      but here, she tiptoes at midnight,<br>
      afraid of footsteps louder than hers
      </p>
      
      <p>
      They told us —<br>
      "You are Devi ,So sacred,So pure,So untouchable"<br>
      except when they touch.<br>
      Too loud, too expressive, too visible — a shame.<br>
      Too shy? Too numb? no movements yet blamed.<br>
      (kya bhai sensation nahi hai kya?)
      </p>
      
      <p>
      We grew up fitting into frames<br>
      We were never photo-sized for<br>
      'US' meant to carry purity in our veins,<br>
      to cleanse the culture, bear the chains.<br>
      Fit in the boundaries of expectation to<br>
      "maintain purity of blood and culture"<br>
      Heh . this isn't a consequence, it's the cause.<br>
      why woman fumble and whisper their words<br>
      shape and reshape themselves to adjust<br>
      yet Why gaalis are all mother-sister wrapped<br>
      Why izzat lies in her skin,but never in his sin.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Well , once you're an ideal,<br>
      you're no longer allowed to fail<br>
      So Don't call me goddess,<br>
      if it means I can't cry.<br>
      Don't worship my patience,<br>
      And ask me to be shy.<br>
      Let me be — flawed and loud,<br>
      Not your virtue, not your pride,<br>
      not a symbol you decide<br>
      Im just a person , let me BE.

      <p>
      Roots in soil, and fire in skin,<br>
      Tangled deep, both caged within.<br>
      The earth holds tight, so still, so sound —<br>
      But this urge? It shakes the underground.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Soft whispers curl like vines at night,<br>
      Fingers of want brushing out of sight.<br>
      A plea for touch, a quiet moan,<br>
      But silence wraps it — skin to bone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      I won't disturb your steady grace,<br>
      Won't beg for room, won't claim a space.<br>
      But oh — the pulse that floods my veins,<br>
      Like monsoon heat behind windowpanes.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      These roots — they hold, they choke, they feed,<br>
      But don't they feel this silent need?<br>
      To bloom beyond what they were told,<br>
      To ache in ways too raw, too bold?
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The tree above stands proud and tall,<br>
      Bathed in light, admired by all.<br>
      But underground, where no eyes pry,<br>
      I writhe, I breathe, I wonder why.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Why must my longing stay so tame?<br>
      Why does desire come with shame?<br>
      Why does this body burn so loud —<br>
      Yet taught to hide beneath the shroud?
      </p>
      
      <p>
      I'm made of petals, sweat, and storm,<br>
      Of hunger dressed in proper form.<br>
      Of cracked restraint, of sweet unrest,<br>
      Of wanting more, and giving less.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      So here I stay — with roots grown deep,<br>
      And cravings I don't dare to keep.<br>
      Still smiling like I've made my peace…<br>
      But darling, this calm? It's just my leash.

      How happy i was, even with the vulnerability of losing you<br>
      But this certainty is scratching the core of my heart that I've already lost u<br>
      I was been told it'll hurt less as time passed<br>
      But it hurts more, realising that the distance WOULD last
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This distance, playing the streaks game with me<br>
      Sharing 1 snap at a time, as reminder to our existence<br>
      And the moments all in past tense<br>
      Should i break it or continue?<br>
      Should i let the glimpse go or pursue
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The story of realizations that hurts & Reality that burns<br>
      With each passing day, your absence has become the essence of love<br>
      for me, the truth and it's bitterness has spread all through and through<br>
      like tea in boiling water, here evaporates the hope and all the wills flee
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Giving up the zeal, No complaints no agony, numbness is all i can feel<br>
      Probably here starts the journey where even my wounds would heal<br>
      Probably "moving on" was not the holy grail…
      </p>
      
      <p>
      i still need to experience more of it 
      more of raw emotions ache
      more of pain MORE OF YOU...<br>
      calls never responded
feelings never expressed 
Talks yet to fumble, 
Eye contacts yet to break 
Whispers yet to be murmured 
yearning yet to be composed
Outcry yet to be unheard
Tears yet to be rubbed unnoticed

      Even when i cried<br>
      All i can recall was<br> 
      Him being absent<br>

      All i can recall is me calling him…<br>
      Yet him being absent

      <p>
      He tried, surely he must have<br> 
      Not like he didnt love me<br> 
      I mean he claimed that he DID<br> 
      And he promised to change<br> 
      And made versions of himself
      </p>
      
      <p>
      He explained how the newer version is better one<br> 
      How the new him is based on the last fight<br> 
      And how he did make efforts of changing himself<br> 
      All on the basis of my prompts, of what i said 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      And surely he must have<br> 
      The changes were all so visible<br> 
      So much distinguishable<br> 
      That he made sure i counted them everyday

      But then, again, the moment<br> 
      In every little inconvenience<br> 
      All his versions, with no delay<br> 
      Would morph them all together<br> 
      Left with where it all started….<br>
